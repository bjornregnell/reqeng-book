\begin{Slide}{Requirements as Solution Constraints}

\begin{itemize}
\item U: the \textbf{universe} of all possible software systems

\item S: the \textbf{solution space}, a subset of U including\\all systems that \textbf{fulfill the spec}

\item S contains both ''\textbf{good}'' and ''\textbf{bad}'' systems

\item The \textbf{general purpose} of RE:
\begin{itemize}
\item to \textbf{constrain the solution space} so that software development is likely to produce a \textbf{good enough} solution

\end{itemize}
\item The reqt spec should be a good enough definition of what we mean with a ''good enough solution''

\item RE is the \textbf{foundation for software quality}.
