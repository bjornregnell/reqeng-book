\begin{Slide}{RE in the Development Process}

\begin{itemize}
\item RE interprets stakeholders intentions into validated req specs
\item RE provides input to, and learns from down-stream activities
\begin{itemize}
\item System Design
\begin{itemize}
\item Quality reqs determine architectural decisions
\end{itemize}
\item System Implementation
\begin{itemize}
\item Functional reqs (data and logic) are realized in code  
\end{itemize}
\item System Verification 
\begin{itemize}
\item The req spec define correct output in test cases
\end{itemize}
\item System Operation
\begin{itemize}
\item User feedback is input to requirements evolution
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item As requirements evolve you must manage impact of changes
\item Traceability: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Links among artifacts to support change management
\item Forwards: from requirements to down-stream activities
\item Backwards: from requirements to stakeholders

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
