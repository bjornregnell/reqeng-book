\begin{Slide}{Prioritization Methods Combined}
Example of how prioritization techniques can be combined:
\begin{itemize}
\item Start with a high-level grouping of features that are highly interdependent to reduce the number of prioritization objects
\item Sort all features of small groups in benefit order
\item Use Top-5 for groups with large number of features
\item For selected groups that are most important for the coming release:
  do a ratio-scale prioritization with the 100-dollar-test

\end{itemize}
