\begin{itemize}
\item The cost of req defects increase with time.
\item A req defect that costs $x$ to fix in req validation may cost $100x$ or even $1000x$ in production. 
\item Why may cost of req defects increase exponentially? 
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of dependent artifacts multiply over time
\item If the foundation changes, many things need to be updated
