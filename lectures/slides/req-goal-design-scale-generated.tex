From \textit{why} to \textit{how}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Goal-level: why? intentions of stakeholders and users
\item Domain-level: what users do? how users' tasks are supported by the system to achieve goal
\item Product-level: what the system does? system behavior in terms of input-logic-output
\item Design-level: how? required and justified design choices

\end{itemize}
