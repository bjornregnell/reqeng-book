\begin{Slide}{Abstraction on the Goal-Design-scale}

From \textit{why} to \textit{how}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Goal-level: why? intentions of stakeholders and users
\item Domain-level: what users do? how users' tasks are supported by the system to achieve goal
\item Product-level: what the system does? system behavior in terms of input-logic-output
\item Design-level: how? up-front design choices; are they really required and justified?  

\end{itemize}
Which level is best? It depends.
\begin{itemize}
\item Too much 'how' may over-constrain the solution space giving too little freedom for developers to find the best solution.  
\item Without 'why' the risk is high of an unsuccessful solution.

\end{itemize}
