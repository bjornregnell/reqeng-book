\begin{Slide}{Context Diagram}

\begin{itemize}
\item A diagram describing the environment of a product
\item The named product in the center as a \textbf{closed} box
\item Entities interacting with the product are connected by arrowed lines to show data flow direction
\begin{itemize}
\item User roles (actors), shown as straw man icons
\item Other connected systems, shown as named closed boxes
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Inner domain}: \textit{direct} interaction with product
\item \textbf{Outer domain}: \textit{indirect} interaction with product
\item If product is shown as an open box with system parts inside then it is an architecture diagram, \textit{not} a context diagram
\item Accompanying explaining text, including explicit requirements: ''the system shall have interface X''


\end{itemize}
