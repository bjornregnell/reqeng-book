\begin{Slide}{Scale of RE}
\begin{itemize}
\item The RE effort increases exponentially with size! 
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of requirements: $N$
\item Number of pairwise relations: $R = N(N -1)/2 \approx N^2$
\end{itemize}
\item Orders of magnitude:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Small-scale RE}: \hfill $N \approx 10^1$, $R \approx 10^2 = 100$
\begin{itemize}
\item requires small effort, all pairwise relations can be considered 
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Medium-scale RE}: \hfill $N \approx 10^2$, $R \approx 10^4 = 10~000$ 
\begin{itemize}
\item feasible but requires large effort, consider subset of relations
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Large-scale RE}: \hfill $N \approx 10^3$, $R \approx 10^6 = 1~000~000$
\begin{itemize}
\item  unfeasible unless requirements are bundled into groups with high cohesion within groups and low coupling across groups
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Very large-scale RE}: \hfill $N \approx 10^4$, $R \approx 10^8 = 100~000~000$
\begin{itemize}
\item unfeasible even if requirements are bundled into groups as the groups become either too many or too large
\item feasible only if the system can be split into subsystems with independent RE
