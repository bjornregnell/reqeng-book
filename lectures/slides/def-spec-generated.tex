\begin{Slide}{What is a Requirements Specification?}

\begin{itemize}
\item A simplistic definition:  
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{''A document that describes what the system should do''}
\begin{itemize}
\item what is what and what is how?
\item how much about the context is needed?
\item not always a document; database, issue tracker, prototype, ...

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item A collection of requirements models + Help for the reader

\item Expressed using a combination of suitable media, such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item text
\item diagrams
\item prototypes
\item test cases
\item videos
\item ...

\end{itemize}
\item Similar to a shopping list:
\begin{itemize}
\item You don't always get what you want.
\item You often want things that you don't need.

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
