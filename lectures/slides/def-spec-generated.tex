\begin{Slide}{What is a Requirements Specification?}

\begin{itemize}
\item A collection of requirements models with supporting information to help interpretation

\item Expressed in a combination of suitable styles:
\begin{itemize}
\item natural language
\item formal language (controlled syntax and semantics)
\item diagrams
\item tables
\item pictures
\item videos
\item prototypes
\item ...

\end{itemize}
\item Similar to a shopping list:
\begin{itemize}
\item You don't always get what you want.
\item You often want things that you don't need.

\end{itemize}
