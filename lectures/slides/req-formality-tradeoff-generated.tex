\begin{Slide}{Level of formality? -- a difficult tradeoff}
\begin{itemize}
\item Formality in various aspects to a varying degree:
\begin{itemize}
\item Very informal: free-form representation, no explicit rules 
\begin{itemize}
\item examples: slide presentation, textual narrative
\end{itemize}
\item Very formal: formal syntax, operational semantics, inference
\begin{itemize}
\item examples: state machine, regular expression, predicate calculus
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Advantages of formalization:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reduced ambiguity
\item More concise models
\item Enables tooling: automatic checks, proof of soundness, ...
\end{itemize}
\item Disadvantages of formalization:
\begin{itemize}
\item Harder to understand
\item Requires effort, specialized knowledge and skills
\item Limited in scope and expressive power
\item Some stakeholders cannot contribute in validation

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
