\begin{itemize}
\item Domain-focused logic: 
\begin{itemize}
\item users' work and system behaviour is joint
\item the work split is decided in later design
\end{itemize}
\item Product-focused logic: 
\begin{itemize}
\item users' work and system behaviour is separated  
\item the work split is explicitly specified in req spec
 

\end{itemize}
