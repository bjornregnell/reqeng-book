Elicitation challenges: Stakeholders often...
\begin{itemize}
\item cannot abstract 
\begin{itemize}
\item difficult to explain what they do and why
\item difficult to express what they (really) need
\item ask for specific solutions
\end{itemize}
\item lack imagination 
\begin{itemize}
\item of new ways of working
\item of consequences of new solutions
\end{itemize}
\item complicate the picture
\begin{itemize}
\item have conflicting demands
\item actively resist change
\item have luxury demands, ''gold plating''
\item have new demands once others are met

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
