\begin{Slide}{Explicit or implicit requirements?}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Explicit} requirement: 
\begin{itemize}
\item has a unique id, such as a mnemonic (short name) or number
\item often has status, priority, or similar 
\item often has an explicit ''shall''-statement
\item often has links to other related spec parts with id
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Implicit} requirement:
\begin{itemize}
\item part of spec but no id, no status, no ''shall'' 
\item is text/diagram a requirement or just help for the reader?
\end{itemize}
\item Advice: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Make most important requirements explicit.
\item Link diagrams to explanatory text with explicit requirements.
