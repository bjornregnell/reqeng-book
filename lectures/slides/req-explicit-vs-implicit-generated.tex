\begin{Slide}{Explicit or implicit requirements?}

\begin{itemize}
\item An explicit requirement: 
\begin{itemize}
\item has a unique id, such as a mnemonic (short name) or number
\item often has status, priority, or similar 
\item often has an explicit ''shall''-statement
\item often has links to other related explicit reqs
\end{itemize}
\item Implicit requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item Parts of a spec but without unique id, status, ''shall'' 
\item Diagrams, general text: are they actual requirements or just help for the reader?
\end{itemize}
\item Advice: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Make at least the most important requirements explicit.
\item Combine diagrams with explanatory text; make explicit statements of what is a requirement or not in the diagram.
