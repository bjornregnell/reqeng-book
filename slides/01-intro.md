# What is Requirements Engineering (RE)?

* RE is focused on 
  * the **requirements** of software-intensive systems 
  * the system **context**, including users and connected systems.
  * the **intentions of stakeholders**

* The RE process involves 
  * knowledge-building
  * consensus-building
  * decision-making

# What is a requirement?

* Something **needed** or **wanted**.

* A documented **representation** of\\something needed or wanted.
* The word ''requirement'' has many different meanings:\\
  must, wish, idea, specific design, rationale, ...

* The most **general meaning**:\\
  *any* kind of **information entity** used in RE

* You don't always get what you want and you often want things that you don't need...

> file = def-spec

# What is a Requirements Specification?

* A collection of requirements models with supporting information to help interpretation

* Expressed in a combination of suitable styles:
  * natural language
  * formal language (controlled syntax and semantics)
  * diagrams
  * tables
  * pictures
  * videos
  * prototypes
  * ...

* Similar to a shopping list:
  * You don't always get what you want.
  * You often want things that you don't need.

\LectureOnly{\section{Purpose}}

# Requirements as Solution Constraints

* U: the **universe** of all possible software systems

* S: the **solution space**, a subset of U including\\all systems that **fulfill the spec**

* S contains both ''**good**'' and ''**bad**'' systems

* The **general purpose** of RE:
  * to **constrain the solution space** so that software development is likely to produce a **good enough** solution

* The reqt spec should be a good enough definition of what we mean with a ''good enough solution''

* RE is the **foundation for software quality**.
