# What is Requirements Engineering (RE)?

* RE is focused on the
  * **requirements** of software-intensive systems 
  * **system context**, including users and connected systems
  * **development context**, including stakeholders' intentions 

* The RE process involves 
  * knowledge-building \hfill research
  * consensus-building \hfill agree
  * decision-making    \hfill choose
  * innovation         \hfill generate ideas
  * communication      \hfill be pedagogical

# What is a requirement?

* A simple definition:
  * Something **needed** or **wanted**.
  * A documented **representation** of\\something needed or wanted.

* Are we representing what is **actually** needed or wanted? 

* A ''requirement'' can in practice mean many different things:\\
  must, wish, need, idea, rationale, function, quality, design, feature, decision, option, constraint, ...

* The most **general** meaning:\\
  *any* kind of **information entity** used in RE

# Main Activities

* The 4 main activities of RE: 
  * **Elicitation** \hfill learning
  * **Specification** \hfill modelling
  * **Validation**  \hfill checking
  * **Selection**   \hfill deciding
* Interdependent and intertwined
* Conducted iteratively and concurrently

> file = def-spec

# What is a Requirements Specification?

* A simple definition:  
  * ''A document that describes what the system should do''
    * what is what and what is how?
    * how much about the context is needed?
    * not always a document; database, issue tracker, prototype, ...

* Requirements models + Help for the reader

* Expressed using a combination of suitable media, such as:
  * natural language
  * formal language
  * diagrams
  * prototypes
  * test cases
  * videos
  * ...

* Similar to a shopping list:
  * You don't always get what you want.
  * You often want things that you don't need.

\LectureOnly{\section{The purpose of RE}}

# Requirements as Solution Constraints

* U: the **universe** of all possible software systems

* S: the **solution space**, a subset of U including\\all systems that **fulfill the spec**

* S contains both ''**good**'' and ''**bad**'' systems

* The **general purpose** of RE:
  * to **constrain the solution space** so that software development is likely to produce a **good enough** solution

* The req spec should be a good enough definition of what we mean with a ''good enough solution''

* RE is the **foundation for software quality**.
