# Requirements Modeling

A requirements model...

*  is an informative **representation** of the intended system.

* is an **abstraction** of the intended system 
  * only *some* aspects are represented, 
  * while other aspects are *excluded*.

* captures important knowledge gained from **elicitation**.

* is often textual or a diagram, or both.

* is often part of a **specification**.

* should be **validated** by (some) stakeholders.

# Different modelling aspects 

* Data aspects:
  * What is stored and processed by the system?
  * What is the format of input and output data?

* Business Logic aspects: 
  * How should the system behave in different usage contexts?
  * What output is generated based on input and system state?

# Which modelling technique is best? 

* Different models are good at representing different aspects.

* A combination of models can cover more aspects.

* Model interpretation often requires specific knowledge
